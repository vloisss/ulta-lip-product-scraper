# Ulta Beauty Lip Product Scraper
### Ulta Webscraper using Python, BeautifulSoup, Requests and Pandas

#### Ulta Beauty is a leading makeup retailer which sells both high- and low-end lip products. I wanted to create a project that ties my own interests in makeup with webscraping and modeling data. 

Specifically, I scraped the platform for information on over 700 lip products. This information includes their name, price, rating, reviews, and if they are environmentally conscious. This project will be a valuable tool in cross-referencing makeup prices and ratings with other retailers, and in my own daily life as I regularly use makeup myself.

I sorted the data gathered from scraping Ulta Beauty into a Pandas Dataframe, and input the data into an excel spreadsheet, or csv depending on preference.

## Future Updates

#### Future Steps for this project includes expanding the logic to other makeup retailers and product types, automating the scraping process, and making the scraping process itself more efficient. I look forward to creating a live-update GUI that will be able to provide product updates, like when a user publishes a new review, or when the price of a popular product updates.
